# Personal Projects

This repository contains validation results (plots and case definitions) for literature models implemented from the literature.  
**Code may be provided upon request.**

## Contents
- `models/`: validation folders per literature model
- `references/`: BibTeX and links to original publications

## Scope
Validation focuses on comparing model predictions against published results (e.g., conversion, selectivity, yield, and/or profiles) under reported operating conditions.

## What is included
- Validation plots (parity plots, trends vs operating conditions, profiles)
- Case definitions (operating conditions, feeds, parameters where publicly available)
- Raw data from publications are extracted using WebPlotDigitizer

## What is not included
- Source code, solver implementation, Article documents

## Models
| Model folder | Publication | Notes |
